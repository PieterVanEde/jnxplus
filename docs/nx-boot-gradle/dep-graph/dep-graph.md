# Project Graph

Nx allows [extending the project graph](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/structure/project-graph-plugins#extending-the-project-graph-of-nx).
`@jnxplus/nx-boot-gradle` is able to construct project dependencies automatically by analyzing Spring Boot projects source code and add them to the Nx project graph.

## Usage

```bash
nx dep-graph
```

More information could be found on the [Nx documenation](https://nx.dev/latest/angular/cli/dep-graph#dep-graph).
